# Wrtie-My-README

  ## Description
    READMEs are a staple of any project
    I wanted to be able to create basic templates of a professional README quickly
    This project allows users to make the basic elements of a professional README in their CLI. 
    This template can then be copied and saved to your official README file
    While creating this project, I gained knowledge about the inquirer package, and how to use the CLI 
    to create things based on user input. This README was generated using the Write-My-README application!

  ## Installation
  after copying this codebase into your main project folder, or wherever you wish to initialize it, run:

  ## Usage
  initialize the app by running node index in your command line interface within the project folder.From there, answer the prompts displayed, 
  and your README will be generated in a seperate dist folder, allowing easy editing without replacing your original README
