# Wrtie-My-README

  ## Description
    READMEs are a staple of any project
    I wanted to be able to create basic templates of a professional README quickly
    This project allows users to make the basic elements of a professional README in their CLI. This template can then be copied and saved to your official README file
    While creating this project, I gained knowledge about the inquirer package, and how to use the CLI to create things based on user input
